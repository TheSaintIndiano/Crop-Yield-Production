# Introduction
The science of training machines to learn and produce models for future predictions is widely used, and not for nothing.
Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy. With the continuing expansion of the human population understanding worldwide crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and reducing the impacts of climate change. 

Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and accurate information about history of crop yield is an important thing for making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.  The basic ingredients that sustain humans are similar.

Cuisine varies greatly around the world, the basic ingredients that sustain humans are pretty similar. We eat a lot of corn, wheat, rice and other simple crops. In this project the prediction of top 10 most consumed yields all over the world is established by applying machine learning techniqus. It is a regression problem.
 
 These corps include :

- Cassava                
- Maize                  
- Plantains and others   
- Potatoes                
- Rice, paddy             
- Sorghum                
- Soybeans               
- Sweet potatoes       
- Wheat                  
- Yams             


In the project, machine learning methods are applied to predict crop yield using publicly available data from FAO and World Data Bank.
